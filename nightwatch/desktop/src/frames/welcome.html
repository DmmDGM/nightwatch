            <p>
                To get started, you'll want to join a server by clicking the + icon in the server bar at the top of the screen. <br>
                After that, you can tweak client settings in the top right hand corner.
            </p>

            <h5><b>Service overview</b></h5>
            <p>
                Nightwatch is composed of a client (the desktop app you're using right now), a chat server, and an authentication server. <br>
                To ensure users are unique, users will be assigned an ID ending with the auth server their data is stored on. For example, <br>
                yours is <code>${nightwatch.user.id}</code>. This ID won't change unless you switch authentication servers (available in settings).
            </p>
